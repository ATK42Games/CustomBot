# Custombot
 An open source Python Twitch bot
 The intention is to create a super simple twitch bot that anyone can use
 So far, the architecture is built to include widgets with update functions and such, and basic commands
 I would very much appreciate assistance in expanding the underlying architecture as well as any widgets and commands people can think of
 I still haven't gotten it to boot properly, so I would appreciate some help in troubleshooting
